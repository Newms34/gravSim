# Dave's Gravity Simulation

## What this is
This is a simple gravity simulation using Newtonian mechanics. Pick the number and max size of your particle, and then set the gravitational constant (big G). Finally, press Rescatter to start.

## Sun
The 'Sun' is an immovable, indestructable object that can be activated to act as a centerpoint around which objects will congregate.

## Issues
The collision detection isn't always perfect (especially with the sun!). In addition, if an object larger than the sun collides with it, the object may not be deleted as is appropriate.
